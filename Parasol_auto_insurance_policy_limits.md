Parasol will pay the daily rental charge incurred when an insured rents a car from a car business while your car or newly acquired car is not disabled or being repaired as a result of loss which would be paid to the insured under comprehensive coverage.

Parasol will pay this daily rental charge during the period that starts on the date the vehicle is not disabled as a result of the loss or the vehicle is left at a repair facility if the vehicle is able to be driven.

Payment for car rental from Parasol insurance will end on the earliest of the date the vehicle has been repaired or replaced, the date Parasol insurance offers to pay for the loss of the vehicle if you choose to delay repairs, or seven days after Parasol insurance offers to pay for the loss if the vehicle is stolen and not recovered.

The amount of the car rental must be reported to Parasol insurance before we will pay such an amount.

If you are at fault, to be able to claim for your own lost wages from Parasol Insurance, you need to have the optional Apex plus package which provides coverage of loss of income insurance as part of your policy.
If another driver is at fault, the at-fault driver’s auto insurance company is typically responsible for covering your lost income.

If an at-fault driver is uninsured or doesn’t have enough coverage to pay for your injuries or car damage, Parasol uninsured motorist coverage can help pay the difference. Uninsured motorist coverage is provided as part of the optional "Apex plus" package.

Any claims submitted to Parasol Insurance for loss of income or uninsured motorists must include all information Parasol Insurance needs to meet federal and state requirements.

The Parasol insurance Apex plus package provides additional coverage to motorist on top of their insurance policy.  The Apex plus package includes the following:

Parasol insurance customers who have the Apex plus package will be eligible for reimbursement for loss of income if they are at-fault.

Parasol insurance customers who have the Apex plus package will have coverage if they are in an incident with an uninsured or uninsured driver, if the other driver is at fault.
