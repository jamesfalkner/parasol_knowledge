This document describes how Parasol Insurance handles Fraud Detection. Insurance
fraud covers the range of improper activities which an individual may commit in
order to achieve a favorable outcome (usually getting paid for fake claims) from the insurance company. This could range from staging the incident,
misrepresenting the situation including the relevant actors and the cause of
incident and finally the extent of damage caused.

Parasol uses specialized data analytics techniques like data mining, machine learning, and pattern recognition to analyze data from many sources.

Parasol has a Special Investigation Unit (abbreviated SIU). This unit regularly performs tests and checks to detect fraud. This unit includes employees with backgrounds as police officers, detectives, or medical personnel.

Parasol looks for red flags such as an unusually high number of claims, suspicious conduct, or discrepancies between the application and the facts to detect fraud.
