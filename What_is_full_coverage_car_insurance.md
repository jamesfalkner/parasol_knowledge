## Key Takeaways:

-   Full coverage car insurance is protection that includes collision, comprehensive, and liability coverage. 
-   Often, you can supplement your insurance with uninsured motorist coverage, personal injury protection, medical payments, gap insurance, and other coverage options. 
-   Full coverage typically costs more than minimum liability insurance; however, it may benefit drivers who want to avoid expensive out-of-pocket vehicle repairs.

A full coverage car insurance policy is generally one that includes protection against physical damage, such as collision coverage and comprehensive coverage, in addition to the required liability coverage.

This combination of coverages can provide financial protection if you’re in an accident or if your vehicle is damaged in other incidents, such as vandalism or extreme weather.

Though not required by law, full coverage may be required under certain circumstances.

## What’s in a Full Coverage Policy?

There is no universally accepted definition of full coverage car insurance. Full coverage policies can vary in how they are structured. All coverage specifics and details differ between [tort states](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/full-vs-limited-tort) and [no-fault states](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/what-is-no-fault-car-insurance).

But in general, when someone describes a full coverage car insurance policy, they are referring to policies that include:  

-   **Liability Insurance**: [Liability car insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) offers financial protection if you’re at fault for an accident. A liability insurance policy generally includes bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage. 
-   **Collision insurance**: [Collision coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/collision-car-insurance) will pay for damages to your car that result from colliding with another object, such as a vehicle, tree, or retaining wall. 
-   **Comprehensive insurance**: [Comprehensive coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/comprehensive-car-insurance) pays for vehicle damages resulting from incidents other than collisions. This includes falling objects, hitting a deer, fire, and vandalism. It also will pay if your car is stolen. 

In addition to liability, collision, and comprehensive insurance, full coverage may also include other types of coverage, especially if it’s required by state law. As such, a full coverage policy in your state may include:

-   **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (UM/UIM)**:  [Uninsured motorist insurance (UM)](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/uninsured-motorist-car-insurance) provides coverage when the other party in an accident does not have car insurance and is deemed legally responsible. It can also provide coverage if you are the victim of a hit and run. Underinsured motorist insurance (UIM) helps cover costs when another driver’s insurance is [not enough to cover expenses](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/underinsurance) resulting from an accident they are financially responsible for.
-   **Personal injury protection (PIP)**: Legally required in most no-fault insurance states, this pays for medical expenses for you and your passengers related to injuries sustained in a car accident. [PIP](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance) can also pay lost wages and some other expenses. If you are hit by a car while riding your bike, walking, or riding in someone else’s car, your PIP coverage may extend to these injuries as well. 
-   **Medical payments (MedPay)**: This pays for medical expenses for you and your passengers if you’re injured in a car accident, but it doesn’t cover some of the other expenses PIP can.

Other types of coverage may be included with your car insurance policy, either because you choose to purchase them or because an insurer offers them as an added benefit.

Some of these additional coverages include:  

-   **Gap insurance,** or guaranteed asset protection insurance, covers the difference between your car’s actual value and the amount still owed on a loan or lease. This coverage applies when your car is totaled or stolen while you still owe more than it’s worth. You may choose to purchase [gap insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/gap-insurance) as an add-on, or it may be required by your lender or lessor.  
    
-   **Rental reimbursement insurance** is an optional coverage that can help pay for a rental car if your vehicle is disabled by a covered accident. It can also help pay for other forms of transportation, such as an Uber ride or public transit. It is there to help you stay mobile while your own car is being repaired.  
    
-   **Roadside assistance coverage** can help you deal with the unexpected. Services typically covered by roadside assistance plans are towing, lockout assistance, and fuel delivery. This is usually an add-on coverage, but some insurers may include it as a policy benefit.  
    
-   **Diminishing deductible coverage** can reward you for being a safe driver. Plans may vary by insurer, but typically, your deductible is reduced for each policy period without a speeding ticket or an accident. Some insurers may also refer to this type of coverage as a “disappearing” or “vanishing” deductible.  
    
-   **New car replacement coverage** pays to replace your car with a new one of the same make and model if it’s totaled, rather than paying you for the vehicle’s depreciated value. This coverage is only available for a certain period of time – for instance, when your car is two model-years old or newer. Some insurers may also place a mileage limit on this coverage.

### **Is full coverage car insurance worth it?**

A full coverage car insurance policy can offer more protection in the event of a crash, collision, or other incident. But there are both positives and negatives to consider with this type of policy.  

Pros:

-   Can help you meet lender, lessor, or other requirements
    
-   Can protect you if you’re in an accident and the at-fault driver doesn’t have any or enough coverage
    
-   May cover non-accident-related damages, such as vandalism and theft
    
-   May cover your medical expenses if you are hurt in an accident
    

Cons:

-   Is more expensive than basic liability coverage
    
-   Doesn’t guarantee 100% protection
    

### **Liability vs. full coverage insurance**

Liability insurance refers to a single policy that provides coverage if you’re at fault for an accident resulting in bodily injury or damages to another driver, their vehicle, or their passengers. A liability-only car insurance policy will help you pay for the other driver’s expenses – medical bills, car repairs, etc – but not yours. That’s where full coverage can help.

 Full coverage refers to a collection of coverages that include liability insurance as well as additional forms of coverage, such as collision insurance, comprehensive insurance, MedPay, and personal injury protection.

In most states, drivers must carry a liability insurance policy that meets the state’s minimum coverage requirements. There are no laws that require drivers to carry full coverage, but lenders often require it as part of a loan agreement. The same may be true for drivers that lease a vehicle.

Before shopping around and checking [car insurance quotes](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto), it’s important to know if you are required to carry full coverage and, if so, how much coverage you need. You can find information about state requirements, including bodily injury and property damage liability coverage requirements, through your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

Contact your lender or lessor to find out what insurance requirements are included in your agreement.

## Who Needs a Full Coverage Policy?

If you financed your vehicle and still have a balance on your auto loan, you may need a full coverage policy. You may also need a full coverage policy if you lease your car. That’s because your lender or lessor technically owns your car until you pay off your loan or your lease agreement ends. As such, they have a [financial interest](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/single-interest-insurance) in your vehicle, and a full coverage policy ensures they’ll be paid if the car is damaged before a loan is paid off or you return the car when your lease ends.

If you fail to carry the proper insurance as outlined in your loan or lease agreement, then you may have to pay for [force-placed insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/force-placed-insurance). Read your contract carefully to see if you are required to carry full coverage and, if so, how much you need.

Beyond that, full coverage car insurance is optional. If repairing or replacing your car out of pocket would destroy your family’s finances, full coverage is worth discussing with your insurance company. However, if your car is old, paid off, and not worth much, you may choose to drop collision and comprehensive coverage, as the extra [cost](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/average-cost-of-car-insurance) of insurance may, over time, outweigh the cost of repairs or replacement.

## Full Coverage and Deductibles 

When you purchase a full coverage car insurance policy, you’ll need to select deductibles and limits. A [deductible](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/how-do-deductibles-work) refers to the amount of money you pay out of pocket before your insurer will cover remaining expenses. How and when your deductible comes into play depends on the type of [claim](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/insurance-claim) you make.

Liability car insurance does not include a deductible. If you’re found legally responsible for an accident, your insurer will cover the expenses up to your [liability limit](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/insurance-coverage). For instance, if an accident resulted in $15,000 in property damage and your limit is $25,000, your insurer will cover the costs.

If, however, the total cost of damages was $27,000, your insurer will cover up to your policy limit and you will have to pay the remaining $2,000 out of pocket.

Comprehensive and collision both carry deductibles. That means if your claim is covered under either of those coverages, you’ll need to meet your deductible before your insurer will pay the remaining expenses. For instance, if you have a $500 deductible and a tree falls on your car and causes $4,000 in damage, you will pay $500 and your insurer will pay $3,500.

## Tips to Save on Full Coverage Car Insurance

Full coverage car insurance can be expensive, but there are a few ways to save money and find a full coverage policy that works for your budget.  

-   **Increase your deductible.** A higher deductible amount could result in a lower monthly premium, but be sure to choose a deductible you can comfortably afford out-of-pocket if you need to file a claim. 
-   **Stack discounts.** Car insurance companies commonly offer a range of discounts, from safe driving to multiple policy savings. Many allow for multiple discounts to be applied to a single policy, which could save you up to 20%, depending on your coverage and insurance provider.
-   **Shop around.** Even if you’re happy with your current coverage, it’s wise to reevaluate annually or when you have a significant life event, such as purchasing a new car, a new home, or getting married. 
-   **Improve your credit score.** Increasing your credit score can help drop your car insurance rates, as insurers may use it to determine your risk. However, California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts insurers do not use credit history when determining car insurance premiums.

### FAQ

Though “full coverage” is a common term, it’s a misleading one. A full coverage car insurance policy does not actually cover every type of collision, crash, or incident, nor can you purchase a policy that does. Full coverage auto insurance is a [package policy](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/multiline-insurance) that combines the three basic types of auto insurance coverage – liability, medical, and physical damage – that gives you more protection than the minimum coverage required by your state.

It’s easy to buy a full coverage auto insurance policy. Most auto insurance companies will sell a full coverage policy, or a combination of coverages that provide what we know as full coverage.
