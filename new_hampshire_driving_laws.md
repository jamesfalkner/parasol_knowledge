# New Hampshire Teen Driving Laws

Teenage drivers in New Hampshire are allowed to practice driving beginning at age 15 ½ while accompanied by a licensed adult at least 25 years of age in the front passenger seat. All unlicensed drivers must carry identification that shows proof of age.

Beginning at age 16, teen drivers may apply for a New Hampshire Youth Operator License if they have passed a state-approved driver education course, provide written permission from a parent or guardian, and have logged at least 40 hours of supervised driving practice. At least 10 of those hours must be nighttime driving. In order to receive a license, the applicant must pass a vision screening, a written test and a driver road test, and pay the $50 application fee.

Youth Operator License holders under age 18 are prohibited from driving between 1:00 AM and 4:00 AM During the first 6 months licensed, they may not drive with more than one passenger younger than age 25 who is not a family member, unless a licensed driver at least 25 years old accompanies them.

The New Hampshire Youth Operator License is oriented vertically rather than horizontally and states: "Under 21 until [date]". It expires on the individual's 21st birthday, at which time they are eligible to obtain a horizontally-oriented driver's license.
