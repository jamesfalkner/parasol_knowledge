In Alaska, teens must hold a learner's permit for at least six months and complete 40 hours of supervised driving (including 10 hours at night or in inclement weather) before they can apply for a license. Until a teen driver turns 18, he or she will get a provisional license, which prohibits the driver from riding with passengers under the age of 21 and from being on the road between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM. Teens may drive during those hours if a driver older than 21 is in the car with them. In Alaska, restrictions are lifted at age 18.

In order to receive a license, the applicant must pass a vision screening, a written test and a driver road test, and pay the $50 application fee.
